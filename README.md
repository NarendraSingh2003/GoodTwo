## Introduction

GoodTwo is designed to demonstrate how HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP can be used together to build dynamic and interactive web experiences. The project includes complex animations and transitions to create a smooth, engaging user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - Markup language for structuring web content.
- **CSS** - Styling language for designing the appearance of web content.
- **JavaScript** - Programming language for adding interactivity to the web.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** - A powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations and interactions.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/goodtwo-project.git
   cd goodtwo-project
   ```

2. **Open the project**:

   You can simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser:

   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

   Or, you can use a live server for better development experience.

3. **Install GSAP** (optional, if you are not using a CDN):

   If you're planning to modify the project and want to install GSAP locally instead of using a CDN, install GSAP using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install gsap
   ```

   Then include it in your project:

   ```html
   <script src="node_modules/gsap/dist/gsap.min.js"></script>
   ```

## Usage

1. **Open `index.html`** in a web browser to view the project.
2. **GSAP Animations** are triggered on page load and during user interactions (such as scrolling or clicking). You can explore the animations by interacting with the webpage.

Example of a simple GSAP animation used in the project:

```javascript
gsap.to(".element", {
  duration: 2,
  x: 200,
  opacity: 1,
  ease: "power3.out"
});
```

You can modify these animations in the `app.js` file.

## Project Structure

The project has a basic structure:

```plaintext
goodtwo-project/
│
├── index.html         # Main HTML file
├── styles.css         # Main CSS file
├── app.js             # JavaScript for interactivity and animations
└── assets/            # Folder for images, fonts, or other assets
```

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the webpage.
- **styles.css**: Defines the styling and layout of the webpage.
- **app.js**: Contains JavaScript logic, including GSAP animations.
- **assets/**: Stores images and other static files used in the project.
